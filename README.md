<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## üí° About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

### Inspiration
Being an avid user of Google Tasks, I found the lack of a desktop client to be an inconvenince. Whenever I needed to access my todo lists on my laptop, I would have to navigate to Google Calendar, which took precious seconds to load (Google Tasks doesn't have a dedicated website). 
<br>
So how did I go about saving myself those few seconds a day? 
<br/>
I spent hours building a desktop client for Google Tasks, of course.

### Challenges
Having never built a desktop application, It was a challenge to understand the basics of Electron and integrate it with Next.js

The largest obstacle I overcame during development was the lack of detailed documention for Google's APIs. 

### Built With

-   [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Google OAuth2](https://developers.google.com/identity)
-   [Google Tasks API](https://developers.google.com/tasks)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

NPM is required to run this project.

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Setup
1. Create a new project on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Navigate to the project's Library tab, and enable Tasks API (not Cloud Tasks API).
3. In the Credentials tab, create an API key AND a web application OAuth client ID.
4. Inside your client ID, add `http://locahost:8000` to the authorized JavaScript origins and Authorized redirect URIs.
4. Finally, Navigate to the OAuth consent screen. Besides filling out the required information, add the scope Tasks API (../auth/tasks).

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pillious/Electron-Tasks.git
    ```
2. Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Create a `.env.local` file inside the `./renderer` folder.
4. Enter your Google Cloud project secrets in `env.local`
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```
5. Run the project
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
